#Roomba battle

Made within 4 days a local multiplayer tabletop battle with up to 4 players. We did this with 4 developers at the start of the 2nd semester of our study in Creative Software Development. The game features power-ups and a small battle arena with controller as the main controls.

Most of the (3d) art is self made.
